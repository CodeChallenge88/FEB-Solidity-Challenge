# Challenge B: Dynamic Minting and Burning Ecosystem Contract

---

## Objective
Create a Solidity contract with advanced token minting and burning capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Configurable Minting Parameters**: Tailor parameters for various conditions.
- **Automated/Manual Burning Mechanisms**: Enable supply regulation through diverse burning methods.
- **Transparent Event Logging**: Ensure accountability with clear event logs.

## Expanded Scope
- **Tiered Minting**: Introduce minting levels based on user behavior or network achievements.

## Innovative Feature
- **AI-Driven Decision-Making**: Utilize artificial intelligence for strategic token supply management.

## Creative Interpretation
- **Unique Scenarios for Minting/Burning Utility**: Encourage proposals of novel use-cases for the minting and burning mechanisms.

## Expected Deliverable
- An optimized Solidity smart contract.
- A comprehensive testing suite.
