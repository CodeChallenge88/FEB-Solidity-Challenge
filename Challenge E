# Challenge E: Supply Adjustment Algorithm

---

## Objective
Develop an advanced algorithm in Solidity for dynamic token supply adjustment.

## Scope
- **Autonomous Adjustment**: The algorithm should autonomously adjust token supply in response to market demand, price changes, and specific triggers.
- **Efficiency**: Focus on minimal gas usage and optimal execution speed.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the algorithm can adapt to future market conditions.

## Expanded Scope
- **Real-World Events Integration**: Integrate real-world events and macroeconomic indicators into the algorithm's logic.

## Innovative Feature
- **Machine Learning Optimization**: Use machine learning to continually refine and optimize supply adjustments.

## Creative Interpretation
- **Simulation Model**: Develop a model to simulate and forecast the long-term impacts of supply adjustments on the token ecosystem.

## Expected Deliverable
- A well-documented and efficient algorithm.
- Simulation scenarios and performance analytics.
- A plan for integrating machine learning.
